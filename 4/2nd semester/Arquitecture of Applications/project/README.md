# Redu - Educational Resources Sharing Platform

This project consisted in the development of an web application for a file sharing platform that, briefly put, allows users to upload resources (one of more files of any type), making them available for others to see and download, in a similar fashion to **Dropbox**. There is also a social component to the website, in the form of a publication system that enables users to create and comment on posts regarding specific resources, as a way to give valuable feedback to the community, as well as a notification system, allowing for a timeline of the most recent changes (uploading or editing).

The main focus of this work was the modelation and prototyping for optimal functionality of the platform, following the usability principles and software patterns taught in class, in order to make it as intuitive and user-friendly as possible. The following architecture was implemented, with load balancers to regulate the traffic between the servers:

* Presentation layer - **Vue**
* Business Logic layer - **Spring** & **Hibernate**
* Persistence layer - **MySQL**

The assignment was developed in the **Applications Engineering** profile of the Master's Degree (2020/21).
