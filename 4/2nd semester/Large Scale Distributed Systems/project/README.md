# Decentralized Timeline

The objective of this project was to develop a **peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralized timeline service** (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook), where each peer can publish in their own timeline, as well as subscribe to other peers' timelines and act as an intermediary in the propagation of their content. The application was built using **Python** and several frameworks such as **Kademlia**, **Asyncio** and **Pymongo**.

The assignment was developed in the **Distributed Systems** profile of the Master's Degree (2020/21).
