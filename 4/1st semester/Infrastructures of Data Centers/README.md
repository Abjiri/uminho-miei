# Wiki.js

The objective of this project is essentially the deployment of the platform Wiki.js in a way that is scalable and boasts high availability and performance, for which the **Google Cloud Platform** was used.

An analysis of Wiki.js was required in order to identify the SPOFs and come up with possible solutions to solve them, for which several tools were used, such as **ISCSI**, **DRBD**, **Heartbeat**,  **Corosync** and **Pacemaker**. In the end, the results of the deployment were tested with **JMeter**.

The assignment was developed in the **Applications Engineering** profile of the Master's Degree (2020/21).
