# Distributed System for storage of pairs <key,value>

The objective of this project was to develop a distributed system for storage of pairs <key,value> in **JAVA** that ensured concurrence and data consistency, with an API for GET/POST requests. The system followed several assumptions: the set of servers is fixed, previously known and there are no failures.

The assignment was developed in the **Distributed Systems** profile of the Master's Degree, in the first semester (2020/21).
