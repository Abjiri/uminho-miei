# Search and Problem Solving Methods

This individual assignment's study case was the Oeiras' county public transportation system, in Portugal, and the objective was to develop a recommendation system for it.

The system's data was provided in Excel sheets, so I wrote a small **Python** program to parse and create a knowledge base from it, after playing around with **Excel macros**
and converting the data to **CSV** format.

Finally, I created a recommendation system in **Prolog**, tested with the **SWI** software, that's able to calculate various types of paths that the user may ask for.

The assignment was developed in **Knowledge and Reasoning Representation Systems**, in the last semester of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
