# 2nd Assignment

In this assignment, we had to face the same problem from the previous assignment as a network transportation problem, 
developing minimization models for the network transportation cost and analysing it with the network optimization software **Relax4**.

The assignment was developed in **Deterministic Methods of Operational Investigation**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree.
