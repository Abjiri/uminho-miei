# Mobile Networks: from 4G to 5G

For this assignment, we had to choose a subject relevant to the curricular unit and write a report on it. 

The chosen theme was the transition from 4G mobile networks to 5G. We do a quick rundown of the evolution of wireless networks since their appearence 
and then focus on the limitations of 4G, as well as motive and vision for 5G.

In the end, we presented our findings to the class through a powerpoint presentation.

The assignment was developed in **Computer Networks**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree.
